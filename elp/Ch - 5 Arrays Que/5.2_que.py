# Write a program which takes as input an array of digits encoding a nonnegative decimal integer D
# and updates the array to represent the integer D + 1. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 9] then
# you should update the array to [1, 3, 0]. Your algorithm should work even if its implemented in a
# language that has finite - precision arithemetic.
